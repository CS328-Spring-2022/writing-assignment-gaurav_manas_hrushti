Some of them are seasonal, some come and go at festivals, some of them are made from imported materials, some of them are exported, some are eaten by only a particular community, some are forbidden in some religions, and what we eat is just the tip of the iceberg compared to what the whole of India eats."

However, a very neat feature is that we're allowed to compare up to 5 items together. So we agreed on a 'baseline term', which will be searched along with individual food items. We can then download the csv files of the data, which has the (relative) amount of searches per week in our time range. These values are numerical, and we scaled each of them accordingly, so that the baseline term has the same values throughout."

This was statewide news, and we're guessing that this made people search for dragon fruit.
